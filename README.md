# Understanding complex social networks: The impact of social features on the diffusion process.


Understanding social interactions and the emergence of social networks can help us understand the flow of market trends, product adoption and diffusion processes. Extant literature has proposed a wide variety of features that can be used to describe networks (e.g., degree distribution, reciprocity, transitivity). Furthermore, it has been shown that in social networks, many such features have surprising regularities (the degree distribution is often broad and reciprocity and transitivity are relatively high). The aim of this thesis is to identify which are the relevant features describing networks, how they relate to social mechanisms and which is their impact on the diffusion of products, ideas and behaviors.
